User guide

This is a guide for using a generator that creates database tables, java Class files, repository files, html files. Initially it was created for the java exam to save a lot of time. Generator uses Spring framework, Thymeleaf, JQuery UI. This lithuanian version is a free open source program, so feel free to modify the program files according to your needs. Steps to reproduce:

1. Copy all files from the repository to your computer.
2. Fill the src/egzaminuidemo2.csv with the data tables names, column names, java variable types of the data in the columns and the data.
3. Fill the src/egzaminui_ataskaita_is_html.csv with the search table names, variable names needed from HTML, java variable types.
4. Fill the src/egzaminui_ataskaita_i_html.csv with the report table names, column names, java variable types of the data in the columns.
5. In the Eclipse program press File/Import... Choose Maven/Existing Maven Projects. Click “Next”. Write the filePath to the demo-master folder or use “Browse” to do that. Then tick the pom.xml checkbox and press “Finish”. The project demo will be added to the Package Explorer.
6. Run src/main/java/egzaminui/demo/DemoApplicationCreate.java as 1 Java Application. Wait till the program finishes working.
7. Press F5 (to refresh the project).
8. Open the file pom.xml in the main demo-master folder. Uncomment the following (delete <!-- at the beginning and --> at the end) and save the file:
<dependancy>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependancy>
9. Go back to Eclipse and run src/main/java/egzaminui/demo/DemoApplication.java as 1 Java Application.
10. Go to the browser and check if the database with the tables and data was created. http://localhost/phpmyadmin/server_databases.php 
11. Check if the program works http://localhost:8080/  for the data tables CRUD (create, update, delete).
12. Edit search .java files in the src/main/java/egzaminui/demo/ category and search .html files in the src/main/resources/templates/ category according to the required task. 
13. If needed add @OneToMany and @ManyToOne in other .java files to create bonds between the tables (examples are commented in .java files).
14. Add foreign keys in the database.
15. Do not forget to stop the program and refresh the project before trying to run the program again.
16. If you need to delete my program's files, just run src/main/java/egzaminui/demo/HideTracksApplication.java as 1 Java.
17. If you need to delete all the files that were autocreated, just run src/main/java/egzaminui/demo/DemoApplicationDelete.java as 1 Java.

P.S. If you have enjoyed my program and will be using it, or want to help me release the english version and other cool adds like autocomplete, radio, ajax CRUD, or if you like the automated exam generator idea or a female in programming, you may support me via paypal toma.saltane@gmail.com. Thank you in advance :)
